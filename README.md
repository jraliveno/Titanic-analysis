# Titanic Survival Data Analysis

Eugene Boachie  

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project explores the Titanic dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The goal is to analyze survival trends and derive meaningful insights from passenger data.

## 📁 Dataset

We use the [Titanic dataset](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/doc/data/titanic.csv), which contains demographic and survival information of passengers aboard the Titanic.

## ❓ Key Questions Explored

1. What percentage of passengers survived the Titanic disaster?
2. Did gender affect the chances of survival?
3. What role did passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd) play in survival?
4. Were younger passengers more likely to survive than older ones?
5. Was there a relationship between the number of siblings/spouses aboard and survival?
6. Did embarkation location (Cherbourg, Queenstown, Southampton) affect survival rate?
7. What was the survival rate for passengers traveling alone versus with family?
8. Is there any noticeable correlation between fare paid and survival?
9. How many children (under age 16) were on board and how many survived?
10. What was the average age of survivors versus non-survivors?
