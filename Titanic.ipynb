By examining various features like gender, age, class, and embarkation point, we aim to uncover key patterns in the data.\n\nThe specific questions we will address are:\n\n1. What is the overall survival rate of passengers?\n2. How does survival rate vary by passenger class?\n3. What is the survival rate by gender?\n4. How does age influence the survival rate?\n5. What is the impact of embarking at different locations on survival?\n6. How does the number of family members onboard (SibSp + Parch) influence survival?\n",
